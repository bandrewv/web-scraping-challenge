## Chromedriver.exe
In the Resources/chromedriver folder, I have put the chromedriver Version 85.0.4183.102 for Windows.

For the code in the Splinter section to run correctly, you will need to download chromedriver.exe file from
this site: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

The version you will need depends on two factors: 1) your version of Chrome and 2) your operating system
* To check your version of Chrome, open the web browser, navigate to Settings, click 'About Chrome' and your
version should be displayed. Take the first two numbers of the version to choose the correct download
