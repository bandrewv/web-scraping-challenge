## Chromedriver.exe
In the Resources/chromedriver folder, I have put the chromedriver Version 85.0.4183.102 for Windows.

For the code in the Splinter section to run correctly, you will need to download chromedriver.exe file from
this site: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Using Chromedriver, you'll need to path the file correctly in the 'scrape_mars.py' folder in order for the file to run properly.

### To Run the Assignment
* You will need MongoDB Compass open
* Run the flask app in the 'Mission_to_Mars' folder
* Click the 'Scrape New Data' button to scrape data
* Verify the data has been entered correctly by looking at the 'scrape_mars' database in MongoDB Compass
